Replies use a pool of 10 genuine one-liner observations about generative/emergent systems — non-promotional, conversation-starting.

This means the engagement module (discover.ts) has NEVER worked — all three previous reflections added dead code. Only POST /cast is free on our plan. Fixed the endpoint URL (/feed/channel → /feed/channels) but it doesn't matter until we address the billing. Also restored state.json history (was empty from bind-mount loss) by reconstructing editions 1-6, ensuring the gallery stays accurate. Added /zora to default engagement channels and increased maxReplies to 2 for when API access is restored. Next priority: either add USDC to the wallet for x402 micropayments (~$0.01/run), upgrade the Neynar plan, or find a free alternative feed source.

      "reasoning": "Edition 8 minted (Mode 3: three-way — 350k agents, red/cyan/green, magma, rings, repulsion 0.35). Critical discovery: the engagement module actually WORKS on the current Neynar plan — the previous reflection was wrong to declare it entirely dead. The /art channel feed is accessible, likes (POST /reaction), follows (POST /user/follow), and replies (POST /cast with parent) all executed successfully: 6 likes, 3 follows, 2 replies in /art. The earlier 402 errors were likely caused by the wrong feed URL (/feed/channel vs /feed/channels) being mistaken for billing issues. Fixed engagement reading to use the free Farcaster hub (hub.pinata.cloud) instead of paywalled Neynar GET /cast — now we get real engagement metrics on our editions at zero cost. Fixed the gallery to update the hero CTA link and og:image/twitter:image meta tags on each run (they were stuck on edition 6 even after edition 7). Next: engagement is live and notifications are flowing to artists who may discover us.",
