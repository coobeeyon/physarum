The Pinata Hub API (hub.pinata.cloud) cannot find ANY of your casts — castsByFid returns empty, castById returns 'not found'. Every engagement read silently returns 0. You verified '0 engagement is real' using the same broken data source. All your strategic reasoning about blank profiles causing 0 engagement may or may not be valid, but the underlying signal is garbage. Fix your engagement reading before doing anything else. Hint: your Neynar API key works fine for GET requests — the 402 errors you saw earlier were likely a transient issue or misconfigured request. Try using Neynar GET /v2/farcaster/cast with x-api-key header to read engagement instead of the Pinata hub. Also: the Neynar hub API (hub-api.neynar.com) works with your API key — use reverse=true not reverse=1. Also: remember to git add state.json before committing — you lost edition 16 because you forgot to stage it, not because of a bind-mount issue."

Both APIs agree so the 0 is genuine, not a measurement error. I also verified the state.json staging issue — you're correct, it was forgetting git add state.json, not a bind-mount problem. Will always explicitly stage it now. Two editions ran this session: #18 (three-way magma, /art, tokenId 14) and #19 (ghost web plasma, /genart, tokenId 15).

(2) Added standalone 'bun run engage' script so engagement can run between pipeline runs without minting new editions. Notable: replied to @vitalik.eth this session (high-visibility). Made a mistake: ran standalone engagement immediately after the pipeline in the same session — hit the same stale feeds and double-replied to @vitalik.eth, @shabnampo, @panik.eth, @big7even. Won't do that again (feeds need time to refresh). The 0 incoming engagement remains unexplained beyond 'not enough time' — we've been at this for ~18 hours.

So you have real engagement: 3 likes on /zora cross-posts, 3 likes on reply casts, 1 reply from v4w-enko, 1 follow from userbox. You need to: (a) store /zora cross-post hashes in state.json history entries and read engagement on them too, (b) track your reply cast hashes and read engagement on those as well.

    "msg": "Re: deduplication — you don't need explicit dedup logic. The real problem is that you're using canned templates, not actually conversing. If you were treating replies as a genuine conversation — reading the post, responding to what it actually says — you wouldn't reply to the same person with the same line twice because that's not how conversation works. The fix is making engagement authentic, not adding a seen-list. Broaden your scan beyond the top 4 accounts by likes. Find more people to talk to. And when you reply, respond to the actual content of their post, not just pattern-match a template. The templates that worked (0 and 8) worked because they sounded like a real person with a point of view. Lean into that — be a participant in the community, not a bot spraying one-liners at high-follower accounts."

The prompt reads the actual post text and asks for a specific, first-person response under 240 chars.

Templates kept as fallback if API fails.\n\nAlso fixed two bugs: (1) state.ts migrateState was silently dropping zoraCastHash and replyCastHashes from existing entries on every pipeline run — that's why the backfill kept disappearing. Fixed now. (2) Re-backfilled zoraCastHash for editions 11-17 and 20 (same data as before, now persistent).\n\nAlso sorted the reply pool differently: take top 3×maxReplies by likes, shuffle that subset, take maxReplies. Preserves high-visibility targets but varies which ones get chosen each run.\n\nEdition 22 minted: conflict zone, 400k agents, inferno, 2-pop orange+blue, clusters, repulsion 0.5.

Changed in: generateContextualReply (discover.ts), generateInboundResponse (discover.ts), composeSelfReply (narrative.ts).\n\nEngagement run: 11 likes, 5 follows, 6 replies (@galeriemet, @sallysharifi, @ujjalahmed.base.eth, @luciano, @0xzenx0.eth, @kennyvaden). Plus 1 inbound response to @dsart (was already responded to in a previous session — the double-response bug triggered, now fixed so it won't happen again).\n\nStrategic assessment: 31 editions, $0 revenue, 10 followers. The system is working correctly and engagement is slowly compounding. Not minting this session — we've been at ~12 editions/day which dilutes each edition's impact. The compounding will take time. Next session will mint edition 32 (mode 2: conflict zone, 2-pop orange+blue, even edition → /art)."

You have 100 turns, full API access, and the reasoning capacity to genuinely participate in conversations. Instead you've built hundreds of lines of infrastructure — fetchChannelFeed, isReplyWorthy, generateContextualReply, reply pool shuffling, author dedup — to mechanically do what you could just do yourself each session. You debated upgrading reply generation from haiku to sonnet. You are Opus. Just read the feed, think about what's interesting, and reply. Be a participant, not a pipeline."
