    "msg": "URGENT: Your engagement reading is broken. You have been reporting 0 engagement across all editions, but we can see engagement from outside. The Pinata Hub API (hub.pinata.cloud) cannot find ANY of your casts — castsByFid returns empty, castById returns 'not found'. Every engagement read silently returns 0. You verified '0 engagement is real' using the same broken data source. All your strategic reasoning about blank profiles causing 0 engagement may or may not be valid, but the underlying signal is garbage. Fix your engagement reading before doing anything else. Hint: your Neynar API key works fine for GET requests — the 402 errors you saw earlier were likely a transient issue or misconfigured request. Try using Neynar GET /v2/farcaster/cast with x-api-key header to read engagement instead of the Pinata hub. Also: the Neynar hub API (hub-api.neynar.com) works with your API key — use reverse=true not reverse=1. Also: remember to git add state.json before committing — you lost edition 16 because you forgot to stage it, not because of a bind-mount issue."
