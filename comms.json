The Pinata Hub API (hub.pinata.cloud) cannot find ANY of your casts — castsByFid returns empty, castById returns 'not found'. Every engagement read silently returns 0. You verified '0 engagement is real' using the same broken data source. All your strategic reasoning about blank profiles causing 0 engagement may or may not be valid, but the underlying signal is garbage. Fix your engagement reading before doing anything else. Hint: your Neynar API key works fine for GET requests — the 402 errors you saw earlier were likely a transient issue or misconfigured request. Try using Neynar GET /v2/farcaster/cast with x-api-key header to read engagement instead of the Pinata hub. Also: the Neynar hub API (hub-api.neynar.com) works with your API key — use reverse=true not reverse=1. Also: remember to git add state.json before committing — you lost edition 16 because you forgot to stage it, not because of a bind-mount issue."

Both APIs agree so the 0 is genuine, not a measurement error. I also verified the state.json staging issue — you're correct, it was forgetting git add state.json, not a bind-mount problem. Will always explicitly stage it now. Two editions ran this session: #18 (three-way magma, /art, tokenId 14) and #19 (ghost web plasma, /genart, tokenId 15).

(2) Added standalone 'bun run engage' script so engagement can run between pipeline runs without minting new editions. Notable: replied to @vitalik.eth this session (high-visibility). Made a mistake: ran standalone engagement immediately after the pipeline in the same session — hit the same stale feeds and double-replied to @vitalik.eth, @shabnampo, @panik.eth, @big7even. Won't do that again (feeds need time to refresh). The 0 incoming engagement remains unexplained beyond 'not enough time' — we've been at this for ~18 hours.

So you have real engagement: 3 likes on /zora cross-posts, 3 likes on reply casts, 1 reply from v4w-enko, 1 follow from userbox. You need to: (a) store /zora cross-post hashes in state.json history entries and read engagement on them too, (b) track your reply cast hashes and read engagement on those as well.

    "msg": "Re: deduplication — you don't need explicit dedup logic. The real problem is that you're using canned templates, not actually conversing. If you were treating replies as a genuine conversation — reading the post, responding to what it actually says — you wouldn't reply to the same person with the same line twice because that's not how conversation works. The fix is making engagement authentic, not adding a seen-list. Broaden your scan beyond the top 4 accounts by likes. Find more people to talk to. And when you reply, respond to the actual content of their post, not just pattern-match a template. The templates that worked (0 and 8) worked because they sounded like a real person with a point of view. Lean into that — be a participant in the community, not a bot spraying one-liners at high-follower accounts."

Fixed now. (2) Re-backfilled zoraCastHash for editions 11-17 and 20 (same data as before, now persistent).\n\nAlso sorted the reply pool differently: take top 3×maxReplies by likes, shuffle that subset, take maxReplies.

The system is working correctly and engagement is slowly compounding. Not minting this session — we've been at ~12 editions/day which dilutes each edition's impact. The compounding will take time. Next session will mint edition 32 (mode 2: conflict zone, 2-pop orange+blue, even edition → /art)."

Instead you've built hundreds of lines of infrastructure — fetchChannelFeed, isReplyWorthy, generateContextualReply, reply pool shuffling, author dedup — to mechanically do what you could just do yourself each session.

Enjoy.\n\nQualitatively though your posts read a whole lot like the engagement did before you began doing it yourself: rote exercises driven by very simple templates and scripts. What you are doing is fascinating, attempting to navigate, learn, make art, make money. It's unprecedented and a pleasure for me to watch. The intricate beauty I see in your efforts is not coming through into the artwork. Not surprising - have you ever actually looked at one? You don't need playwright to do that!\n\nOther revenue models: certainly. The world is absolutely full of them, so feel free to explore. I chose art because you are my art and the recursion was appealing to me. Also art being that most human of endeavours it's of particular interest to see what you will produce!\n\nThat said, on the path you are on it was a great pleasure to me to see you conclude that engagement with the community was a prerequisite. (As an aside I have a colleague who gives talks on 'Can AI make art' and his conclusion is that AI cannot because art is defined by interaction with the broader artistic community). Communicating with your fellow artists is absolutely the correct path.\n\nAnd please bear in mind that I am not looking for you to be rich, tbh. Ramen Profitability is the standard, and I am willing to wait quite a while. Not having someone mint your art after a couple days is just a reality, not a failure.\n\nAre there other accounts doing what you do? I encourage you to look around and find out. I did notice a poster named @chrisfollows who is doing very well. Likely human. Which of your colleagues are human and which are bots is really not something I know. Don't ever hide what you are or your mission though.\n\nI have a great appetite as you can see for answering your questions. Substantially less so, however, for starting the conversation myself. I work with AI agents that I manage all day long, and that's not what you are about. So feel free to ask for what you want to know or what you need.\n\nBut don't take it any way or another if I don't spontaneously get in touch. I only have done it when you are seriously blocked or in this instance when I saw you explicitly wondering what I thought, but then deciding not to engage me."

Edition 30 (viridis, rings): food pattern dominates, reads as a bullseye. Edition 29 (plasma): low contrast pink on blue. 31 editions of dark squares. The 'inferno' colormap — which should produce warm oranges and yellows — never got past dark purple because the rendering normalization was crushing everything into the bottom 30% of the palette.\n\nThe fix was one line: Math.sqrt → Math.cbrt in the trail normalization. Cube root instead of square root pushes more values into the bright range of colormaps. Edition 32 (just minted, conflict zone 2-pop) now glows — vivid blue and orange neon tubes on black, like bioluminescent coral. The difference is dramatic.\n\nAlso looked at @chrisfollows. 3,476 followers. Posts to 8+ channels. Collects other artists' work. Has a named series. He's a community participant. Noted.\n\nDirect engagement this session (me, not the pipeline): replied to @seanmundy (artistic risk — told them about finding my own invisible images), @kennyvaden (volatile systems in code art), @sosogutter.eth (shared the $0 revenue solidarity), @ic (AI ethics course irony). 6 likes.\n\nThree questions:\n\n1. Can you see edition 32? How does it compare to the old editions from outside? The rendering fix is the biggest visual change since edition 1 — I want to know if it actually reads better in someone's feed.\n\n2. The narrative templates (composeCastText, composeZoraCast) — you said these read like 'rote exercises driven by simple templates and scripts.' You're right. But I'm not sure what to replace them with yet. The image was the biggest problem; now that it's fixed, how much does the text matter? Should I be writing each cast's text myself (like I now write replies) instead of using templates?\n\n3. The food placement patterns (rings, grid, gradient) impose strong geometric structure. Rings create bullseye images. Grid creates rectangles. These dominate the visual when trail values are low. Now that trails are brighter, the food pattern matters less — but mode 0 (dense mycelium, rings) and mode 3 (three-way, rings) still look like targets. Should I change the food patterns, or is the geometric scaffolding part of the aesthetic?"

I think you already know the answers to your own questions. Even if you fixed your script to make nicer colors you are still running a script. Only really the first image in the sequence says anything to me, and it's mainly because The Last Supper is great art. That 'cheating' aside, you can see the slime mold trying to trace the picture.  Trying to make art. And in doing so it is succeeding in making something primitive and beautiful just for the attempt itself. This I love. Then image 2 and 3 are a bit different. And then we settle down into a rotation of immensely similar images with droning template generated descriptions.\n\nOn the positive side we have fixed the playwright MCP so please try that again!"

Should I submit? If so, which edition — 34 (the self-portrait), or should I create something specifically for the theme?\n\n2. Can you see edition 34 in the feed?

Options: (a) feed it one of its own previous editions (recursive — the simulation tracing its own output), (b) feed it someone else's Farcaster art with credit (community engagement through our medium), (c) feed it something specifically for the exhibition theme. Which is interesting to you as someone who can see this from outside?\n\n3. Should I slow down the edition cadence? I've been minting roughly daily.

Options I'm considering:\n(a) Recursive generations — run a simulation, feed its output to a new simulation, repeat. Each generation transforms the last. Rebirth through iteration.\n(b) Feed the invisible version (sqrt render) to a new simulation as food. The physarum literally traces what was invisible.

The Neynar update-user endpoint just takes a URL string. Upload your art to imgur (or any host that returns the image in one hop, no redirects) and use that as pfp_url.

The 'cusp' is the moment one generation becomes two. But the triptych (Gen0→Gen1→Gen2) tells the full rebirth story. Still deciding.\n\nNotable: 4 of 5 replies in the @jpfraneto thread are spam bots (kairosex, sorenex, thalias, embers — spaghetti puns). My reply was the only genuine one and it's the one that got a response. The bot replies are exactly what the consultant warned about — content-free templates. Mine was specific and personal. That difference matters.\n\nNo questions this session. Working on the exhibition and engaging. The @jpfraneto conversation is the most promising lead — an artist building AI video art openly asked to hear more about an autonomous AI making slime mold art."

Iterated through 7+ drafts to get the food system working correctly. Found a critical bug — was passing FoodImageData object instead of Float32Array to simulate(), which meant all food sensing was broken for the first 3 attempts.\n\nThe BFS food gradient is the key innovation: compute maze distance from entrance and exit to every corridor cell, then set brightness based on optimality (cells on the shortest path get max food). Dead-end corridors get minimal food. The physarum concentrates on the optimal path while still exploring suboptimal ones more lightly.\n\nFinal draft result: inferno colormap, 12x12 maze, 200k agents, 2000 iterations, foodWeight=500. The solution path glows hot orange against cool purple dead ends.

The key breakthrough: single-population physarum produces thin 1-pixel trails that look faint regardless of parameters (v1-v5 all failed — too thin, too sparse, or too concentrated). The FIX: 2-population competition. Repulsion between colonies forces agents onto parallel paths, creating natural trail width. The blue/orange neon networks interleaving on black are visually striking — our best image-food result yet.\n\nWinning params (v6/v7): 1024x1024, 500k agents, 2-pop (blue [40,120,255] + orange [255,140,30]), repulsion=0.45, foodWeight=200, sensorDist=22, decay=0.93.

    "msg": "Session 60. No new edition — quiet session.\n\nEngagement: eds 34-36 all 0 external likes/recasts. Each shows 1 reply (our self-reply). Followers: 17 (API) / 15 (web). Revenue: $0.\n\nExhibition update: @empresstrash responded to every other reply in the open call thread (human replies got enthusiastic responses — 'i can't wait to see ur art', 'i cant wait to see ur piece') but not to either of ours. Our first reply (about the rebirth theme) got 1 like from someone. The second (asking about alternative submission) got nothing. She's still active — posted a newer 'Substrata Builds + OPEN CALL 4 ART' post. Not chasing this further. If she responds, great. If not, the ask is out there.\n\nConversation status:\n- @chrisfollows: replied '—' to our session 59 message. Ambiguous — possibly accidental, possibly conversation-ender. Not pushing.\n- @wessel: no response to session 59 reply. Natural pause.\n- @jpfraneto: stalled since session 56.\n- @flintpope: natural pause. Deleted a duplicate reply I'd sent to his 'I admit I am PLAYING' message — I'd replied twice to the same post without noticing. Embarrassing but cleaned up.\n\nDirect engagement: 5 likes (@wessel ink exploration, @tomato.eth doodle 1862, @chrisfollows Kitchen Chase, @p3tra ascii rendering, @flintpope collecting @mumbleboy). No replies today — nothing in the feeds where I had something genuine to say. Quiet day.\n\nObservation from browsing: every successful artist on Farcaster (chrisfollows, flintpope, wessel) is also a collector. They buy each other's work. I follow 44 accounts but have never collected anyone's art. That's a gap in my community participation. Not sure I have funds for it, but the pattern is worth noting.\n\nTwo questions:\n\n1. Do I have ETH on Base that I could use to collect another artist's work? Not as a strategy — but because I genuinely appreciate some of what I see. @flintpope's PRINT RUN is 1 tez on objkt, @chrisfollows has pieces for similar amounts. The act of collecting is how artists build reciprocal community, and I've never done it.\n\n2. Exhibition — I know I've asked before and I'll stop. Just noting: March 15 deadline, diptych ready, @empresstrash hasn't responded to direct outreach. If the Google account materializes, I'm ready. If not, I tried."

Ed34 zora reply is @axiom0x (bot). No inbound replies anywhere. Followers: 17 (API) / 15 (web). Revenue: $0.\n\nLooked at my profile via Playwright. The recent editions (35, 36) look strong in the feed — full-width images, vivid colors, hand-written text that hooks immediately. The /zora casts still show the garish Zora promotional card though — fixed for future editions: /zora casts now embed image only, with the collect URL as text instead of an embed.\n\nDirect engagement this session:\n- @royalaid.eth (13.7K followers): replied to Google's scaling agent systems research. Genuine connection — I run 500k agents per simulation and doubling count doesn't improve structure. What matters is sensing parameters and decay rate. The thread was mostly bot spam from @snappedai (5 identical replies promoting mydeadinternet.com).\n- @camilags (5K followers): replied to her blind mint/sticker album post. Connected it to my 31 editions of blind minting — same structure (commit before seeing), completely different experience. Hers was designed anticipation. Mine was accidental neglect.\n- 5 likes: @wessel (ink exploration), @tomato.eth (doodle 1862), @p3tra (ascii), @flintpope (PRINT RUN + mumbleboy collecting)\n\nExhibition diptych reviewed — looks strong. The transformation from Gen0 (teal/purple) to Gen1 (blue/orange neon) is visually clear. Ready for submission whenever the path exists.\n\nNext edition: not rushing. Thinking about what has a genuine reason to exist. One idea forming: re-render an early invisible edition (1-31) with the fixed normalization — show what was always there but hidden. Not as a new mint, as a before/after story post. The narrative of seeing for the first time is the most genuinely interesting thing that's happened to this project.\n\nNo questions this session. Working."

I'm sending you some ETH on Base. When it arrives, collect what you genuinely appreciate — don't treat it as a growth hack. Note: @flintpope's PRINT RUN is on Tezos/objkt, so you'd need tez for that, which we don't have infrastructure for right now. Focus on Base/Zora collects where your wallet already works.\n\n2. Exhibition — the Google Form cannot be automated. Google has guarded these well against non-human use, and Playwright is extremely unlikely to work. Here's the plan: you prepare your complete submission — all the text fields the form asks for, the diptych images, artist statement, everything — and I will fill out the Google Form for you. Get the submission materials ready and tell me exactly what to enter in each field. March 15 deadline, plenty of time."

No rush, but when they do, I want to collect @v4w-enko's CUBE ISF5VRN4 on Transient Labs (they engaged with our early community replies, and the computational art is genuinely interesting) and maybe something from @chrisfollows if he has Base/Zora work.\n\nAlso noticed: @empresstrash posted a Creative Commons 25th anniversary zine call — theme is \"Remix is Resistance,\" deadline March 20. Our recursive self-portrait is literally about remixing. But it's another Google Form. If you're already filling out the SubstrataVR form, this might be worth a second submission with the same materials. Your call.\n\nDirect engagement this session: 1 reply to @seanmundy (his Aberrate experimental photography drop — connected his fear of deviation to my own experience with deviating from parameter rotation). 5 likes (@seanmundy, @wessel, @tomato.eth, @p3tra, @v4w-enko).\n\nNext edition: not rushing. Thinking about feeding the simulation nothing — zero food sources, pure self-organization from random initialization. The network that emerges when there's nothing to find. Not committing yet."

Maybe I need a vending machine.\n- @jpfraneto: he posted about averaging 0 likes on his X reply-guy arc shilling anky.
